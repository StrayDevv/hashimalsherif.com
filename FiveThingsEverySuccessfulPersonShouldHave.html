  <h1>Five Things Every Successful Person Should Have</h1>
  <p>
    Every successful person should have the following five things, which can vary but follow the same criteria.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Spirituality:</strong>
      I believe that every human should be connected with their creator. Set up daily and weekly plans to maintain good spirituality.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Health:</strong>
      Every person should invest in their health, either by following a healthy diet or working out. Always try to be healthy and engage in activities such as workouts, running, and jogging.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Work:</strong>
      Try to work as hard as possible and don't say no to opportunities when you're starting out. Be consistent and never give up.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Lifestyle:</strong>
      Make your appearance a priority. How you dress, how you cut your hair, and how you talk are all important because they influence how people perceive you. Stand out from others.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Education:</strong>
      Learn from the experiences of people around you, including their failures. Listen to people who have done what you're trying to do before. Always read and keep yourself informed.
    </li>
  </ol>
